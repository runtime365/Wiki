# 1 Network Devices

## Basic Network Concepts

**Network**: A collection of interconnected devices that share resources and communicate with each other.

**Client**: A device that requests services from other devices on the network.

**Server**: A device that provides services to other devices on the network.

## Network Infrastructure Devices

### Switches

- **Purpose**: Connect multiple devices within a Local Area Network (LAN)
- **Characteristics**: Multiple ports (typically 8, 16, 24, or 48 ports)
- **Function**: Forward data between devices on the same network

### Routers

- **Purpose**: Connect different networks together and provide internet access
- **Characteristics**: Fewer ports than switches (typically 2-8 ports)
- **Function**: Route data between different LANs and to the internet

### Firewalls

- **Purpose**: Protect networks by controlling traffic flow
- **Function**: Filter network traffic based on predefined security rules
- **Types**:
  - **Hardware Firewalls**: Network-level protection for entire networks
  - **Software Firewalls**: Host-based protection for individual devices

## Network Types

### LAN (Local Area Network)

A network that connects devices within a limited geographical area, such as an office building or home.
