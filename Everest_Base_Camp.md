# Everest Base Camp Trekking Adventure üèîÔ∏è
*November 2024 - An 8-day journey to the roof of the world*

## Day 1: Kathmandu to Lukla - The Adventure Begins

**Namaste and welcome to Kathmandu, Nepal!** Today marks the beginning of an incredible journey to Everest Base Camp. Currently sitting in the bus next to the airplane that will take us to Lukla Airport - famously known as **the most dangerous airport in the world** and the gateway to Everest Base Camp.

### Lukla Airport - The World's Most Dangerous Landing
- **Altitude**: 2,860m above sea level
- **Runway length**: Approximately 500 meters
- **Challenge**: Extremely short runway on a mountain slope
- No assigned seats - it's a race for window spots!

*"Fingers crossed..."* - and WOW! That was the fastest landing I've ever witnessed. We made it safely to Lukla!

### First Impressions
The cold hits immediately - if it's this cold here, I can't imagine what Everest Base Camp will be like. The mountain vibes are absolutely insane, and I barely slept last night due to excitement.

### Trek to Phakding
- **Duration**: 2-3 hours (easy first day)
- **Starting altitude**: 2,700m above sea level
- **Destination**: Phakding
- **Target**: Eventually reaching 5,500m at Everest Base Camp

#### Key Stops & Experiences:
- **Pasang Lhamu Gate**: Named after the first woman to climb Mount Everest 30 years ago
- **National Park Entry**: 2,000 Nepalese Rupees (~$20 USD)
- **First meal**: Breakfast with black tea overlooking the mountains
- **Pack animals**: Met the **Jopkyo** (yaks) that carry luggage from Lukla all the way to Everest Base Camp

### Amazing Sights
- Crystal clear skies with mountain views during trekking
- Plenty of oxygen here (unlike our destination!)
- Entrance to Buddhist villages marked by prayer stones
- Suspension bridges that are "wavy but worth it for the views"

**Blood oxygen level**: 96% (this will drop significantly as we climb higher)

### Evening in Phakding
- **Accommodation**: First night's rest stop
- **Recommended meal**: Garlic soup to boost immune system and help with altitude
- **Preparation**: Carrying Diomax pills for potential altitude sickness symptoms

## Day 2: Phakding to Namche Bazaar - The Real Challenge Begins

**Good morning from freezing temperatures!** The water here is literally the coldest in the world. Early morning porters (Sherpas) collect luggage from hotels to transport to the next destination - without them, this trek would be impossible.

### Today's Challenge
- **Duration**: 6-8 hours of walking
- **Destination**: Namche Bazaar
- **Guide**: Ganam - "the best guide in Nepal"

### Cultural Encounters
- Met local children - the cutest kids ever!
- Played tic-tac-toe games with a 7-year-old
- Traditional "Namaste" greetings throughout the journey

### Spectacular Scenery
- **Thamserku Mountain**: 6,600m high, standing majestically in front of us
- Rivers flowing with mountains as backdrop
- "Pure beauty" at every turn

### Important Checkpoints
- **Sagarmatha National Park**: Drone flights forbidden here
- Soldier checks for drones at entry points
- Multiple rest stops for tea and acclimatization

### Hillary Bridge
- The highest bridge of our trekking route
- "The best one" according to locals
- Narrow paths shared with pack animals carrying supplies (even doors!)

### Arrival at Namche Bazaar
- **Altitude**: 3,440m above sea level
- **Character**: Feels like a city despite the remote location
- **Reality check**: Everything here is transported by donkey or porter
- **Trek duration**: 7 hours to reach this point

### Evening Routine
- **Accommodation**: Hotel with mountain views
- **Dinner**: Sherpa Stew for energy and warmth
- **Luxury expense**: $3-4 USD for a hot shower
- **Reality**: Higher altitude = more expensive hot water, no internet ahead, paying for electricity

**Sleep challenges begin**: Got up 4 times during the night (12am, 2am, 4am, 5am) - likely due to high altitude affecting sleep patterns.

## Day 3: Namche Bazaar - Acclimatization Day

### First Everest Sighting! üëÅÔ∏è

- **Abandoned airstrip**: Used to be for planes from Kathmandu, but direct flights caused too much altitude sickness

### Acclimatization Success

- **Weather**: Incredibly clear skies - "so lucky to capture this much clear sky"
- **Usually**: Cloudy and not this clear
